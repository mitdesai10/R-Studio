# Summary of the Assignment:

# In this assignment, I analyzed the distribution of ATMs in Belgium in 1994. The tasks involved cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and performing statistical analysis using R.

# Key Steps:

# 1. Data Loading and Inspection: Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
# 2. Variable Extraction: Converted each column into individual variables for easier manipulation.
# 3. Data Transformation: Converted necessary variables to numeric types and rescaled the population variable to thousands.
# 4. Handling Missing Values: Identified and counted rows with non-missing values.
# 5. Statistical Analysis: Calculated average values for several variables, considering both non-missing and zero-redefined missing values.
# 6. Comparative Analysis: Analyzed the relationship between the number of ATMs and average withdrawal metrics, and visualized these relationships using line plots.
